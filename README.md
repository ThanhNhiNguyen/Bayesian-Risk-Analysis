We revisit AppleInc. (AAPL) log-return data (n = 1256) through a conjugate Normal–Gamma Bayesian framework. Using weakly infor- mative priors and a two-chain Gibbs sampler (4000 retained draws after a 1000 burn-in), we recover posterior means of μ ≈ 0.0012 and σ2 ≈ 0.0036. Credible intervals, convergence diagnostics, and Bayesian Value at Risk/Expected Shortfall confirm that Apple’s down- side risk is limited and predictable over the analysed horizon.
